TfMM is a tool for herding cats.

The original plan was to try to herd Morris Dancers, but that proved to be out of scope, so instead we are attempting to automate the herding of cats instead.  The cats being herded may look like and act like Morris Dancers but that is an illusion/delusion and must be accorded as such.

More to come.
